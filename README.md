- 👋 Yo, I’m Kai and I was told to create a ReadMe, so here I am.
- 👀 I’m interested in fashion! I love everything to do with designing fashion, the process, the colours, the cuts, the materials..
- 🌱 I’m currently taking GCSE Computer Science, GCSE French, and GCSE Geography, plus qualifying for an external course in fashion design equivalent to a Textiles GCSE!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but I'm working on an ARG, so who knows?
- 📫 Reach me at appleamoeba@gmail.com, or feel free to follow me on Spotify, lol. My profile there is anoeba, no caps.
